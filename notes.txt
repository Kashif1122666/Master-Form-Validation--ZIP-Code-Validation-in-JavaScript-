chapter 85: Form validation :  ZIP CODES

Now, a one-field form that asks the user to enter her ZIP code.
You've already learned how to make sure the user hasn't left the field blank. But how do
you test whether she's entered the right number of digits for a ZIP—5 digits?
HTML gives you a way to keep her from entering too many digits: maxlength=5. But if
you want to make sure she hasn't entered too few digits, you need to use JavaScript. Here's the
function.

function validateZIP() {
     var numChars = document.getElementById("zip").value.length;
     if (numChars < 5) {
     alert("Please enter a 5-digit code.");
     return false;
 }
   }
If the number of characters in the field is fewer than 5, an alert displays and false is
returned to the calling code, cancelling the form submission.



Another question to ask about the ZIP field entry is whether the user has entered only
numbers. Here's the additional code for that.
     function validateZIP() {
         var valueEntered = document.getElementById("zip").value;
         var numChars = valueEntered.length;
            if (numChars < 5) {
                  alert("Please enter a 5-digit code.");
                  return false;
                 }
         for (var i = 0; i <= 4; i++) {
            var thisChar = parseInt(valueEntered[i]);
                if (isNaN(thisChar)) {
                alert("Please enter only numbers.");
                return false;
                       }
                    }
                }
The above for loop code loops through the five characters that have been entered, checking to
make sure that all the characters are string characters representing numbers. Because the five
characters in the field are string characters, each one has to be converted to a number if
possible before being tested. Line 9 does this. Line 10 tests to see whether the attempted
conversion worked. If a number resulted from parseInt in line 9, no problem. But if the
character isn't a number after the conversion attempt—if it isNaN in line 10—an alert displays
and false is returned, cancelling the form submission.
